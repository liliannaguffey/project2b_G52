For running the code, each file in the "main" branch should be in an src folder, with the food.csv file from the database outside of the src folder but inside of the project folder.
In case the food.csv file does not upload correctly, here is a link to the database again. This file should be downloaded then inputted in your local client inside the project folder:
https://corgis-edu.github.io//corgis/csv/food/
The included files in the src should be: 
{ 
Food.cpp
Food.h
heapify.cpp
heapify.h
heapsort.cpp
heapsort.h
main.cpp
main.h
quicksort.cpp
quicksort.h 
}
With each file in the src folder and the database loaded inside the project folder (that also includes the src folder), you should be able to run the main.cpp file with the directory for the project folder.
